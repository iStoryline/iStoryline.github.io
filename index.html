            Storyline visualization techniques have progressed significantly to generate illustrations of complex stories automatically. However, the visual layouts of storylines are not enhanced accordingly despite improvement in performance and the extension of its application area. The existing methods attempt to achieve several shared optimization goals, such as reducing empty space and minimizing line crossings and wiggles. However, these goals are not always conclusive. We conducted a preliminary study to learn how users translate a narrative into a hand-drawn storyline and to check whether the visual elements found in hand-drawn illustrations can be mapped back to appropriate narrative contexts. Moreover, we also compared the hand-drawn storylines with the output of the state-of-the-art automatic layout algorithms and found they have significant differences. Our findings and discussion lead to a design space that summarizes how artists utilize narrative elements and the sequence of actions that artists follow to portray expressive and attractive storylines. We developed an authoring tool, iStoryline, to integrate high-level user interactions into optimization algorithms and achieve a balance between hand-drawn storylines and automatic layouts. iStoryline allows users to create easily a new storyline layout according to their preferences by adjusting an automatically generated layout. The effectiveness and usability of the authoring tool are studied with qualitative evaluations.

            Three design principles (D1 to D3) and three optimization goals (O1 to O3) are defined to track the evolution of relationships between entities and generate aesthetically pleasing and compact storylines automatically.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>D1</b> Lines belonging to the same group should appear next to each other</li>
            <li><b>D2</b> Otherwise, lines must be far from each other</li>
            <li><b>D3</b> A line must keep straight unless the group where is belongs changes</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><b>O1</b> Reducing line wiggles</li>

          iStoryline is composed of three UI components. (a) shows the panels that controls the visual properties of storylines. (b) is the visualization canvas. (c) presents easy-to-use interactions which enable users to lay out storylines according to their design preference.

          <h3>Towards Artist Style</h3>
          <p>In this phase, we want to help students expand their creativity and imagination, so we ask them to freely draw lines using pen and paper without any restrictions. We have selected several line drafts, as shown below, from two artists, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_Johns">Jasper John</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage">John Cage</a>, whose works can inspire students and help them break stereotype about storyline. We have also played a famous concerto (<i>Compact Forest Proposal</i>, created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno">Brian Eno</a>) as background music when students are drawing free lines.</p>

          <h3>Procedural</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Students are divided into several groups and each group has three or four students.</li>
            <li>In each group, every student is asked to follow the rhythm of one instrument.</li>
            <li>Both the line drafts and the music are shown during the process of authoring.</li>
            <li>All drafts from one group are superpositioned together to show the final result.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Visual Encodings</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Lines represent characters.</li>
            <li>Time-axis is placed horizontally.</li>
            <li>The vertical grouping of lines indicates when and who are together.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Procedural</h3>
          <p>In this phase, we ask students to follow these basic visual encodings of storylines, freely choose stories, and manually draw storylines. Students are allowed to use pen with any color and paper with any materials. After they finish the drafts, we first summarize some new features, and then conduct an interview with all students. By doing so, we can understand the design space of hand-drawn storylines and validate the design metric of state-of-the-art techniques. More conclusions can be found in the paper. Selected assignments can be accessible via the gallery link.</p>
